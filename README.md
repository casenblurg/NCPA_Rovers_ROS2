# Rover Documentation and Code

**Introudction**

The point of this documentation is to aid in **setup**, **debugging**, and **creating** software for the Rovers at the National Center for Physical Acoustics (**NCPA**) in the **Battlefield Acoustics Group**. This documentation covers the two types of rovers at the **NCPA**. 
1. LT2 (Smaller Black Rover)
2. TR1200 (Larger Blue Rover)

There is only one **TR1200**, while there are multiple **LT2** rovers. Any documentation reffering to the **LT2** is specifically reffering to work that has been done on the **LT2-3**.
