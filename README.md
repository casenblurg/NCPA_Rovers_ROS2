# Documentation Overview

**Introudction**

The point of this documentation is to aid in **setup**, **debugging**, and **creating** software for the Rovers at the National Center for Physical Acoustics (**NCPA**) in the **Battlefield Acoustics Group**. This documentation covers the software for the two types of rovers at the **NCPA**. 
1. LT2 (Smaller Black Rover)
2. TR1200 (Larger Blue Rover)

There is only one **TR1200**, while there are multiple **LT2** rovers. Any documentation reffering to the **LT2** is specifically reffering to work that has been done on the **LT2-3**.

**LT2-3**

This rover's onboard computer is an [Up Sqaured Pro](https://up-board.org/up-squared-pro/) running **Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS  (Focal Fossa)**. This specific version was retained to preserve compatibility with existing software developed by a collaborating colleagues. Upgrading the OS could risk introducing dependency conflicts or breaking functionality. If you are looking to upgrade the OS, it is recommended to either consult **Nhat Van/Noah Knutson**, or booting from an external had drive/ make a copy of the current OS.
